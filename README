This is a simple blog application using JSF2, Spring3, Spring Security and JPA(Hibernate)

JBoss-4.2.3.GA is the Server used for the development

As Jboss contains the older version of JSF we need to upgrade so that it supports jsf2 and its been provided at this link

Deploying this Simple Blog app:

Database used is Oracle 10g
You need to create a user-blog password-blog and run the Sql Script

you need to create a empty folder having the path defined below
C:/Jar/empty

Note: JPA(Hibernate) jars are not added in the lib folder as it is in JBoss server itself 
(If you are trying to deploy in other server's you need to add the JPA(Hibernate) releated jars)
